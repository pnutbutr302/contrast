## Another $#%^ing blog?
Well, yes!  For years, I wanted to have a blog about product management but...life (and Youtube and Netflix) got in the way of this goal.  (Squirrel!)  And, while my ADHD is not as bad as my nearly two year-old puppy, let's just say I've spent a lot of time learning about a lot of things without honing in on a specific topic.  So, now it's time!

## Another $#%^ing blog about Product Management you say?
Well, actually I'm taking it to the next level.  Yep, you got the SUPER SIZE extra value meal.  This blog is about product management AND machine learning (aka artificial intelligence).  No, I am not trying to generate SEO cred or adwords revenue...As a product manager, I see a growing need for our community to become more knowledgable about what this whole field is about.  So, I am going to share my perspective about various aspects of these two worlds: product management and machine learning.  This blog is not meant to be a technical read about the maths behind the modeling that facilitates machine learning; however, I will do posts about the types of machine learning to evolve your knowledge...that is why you're here after all, right?

## The Deets
I plan to post every two weeks.  If I am crafty enough, then I will even link the posts over to Medium and maybe even onto META, Twitter and whatever the next time-draining interface that arrives to get you back here to read my post :).

## Our interactions
I welcome comments from anyone, except bots unless they're nice bots, who reads my content.  Please keep your comments civil: don't bash anyone else (including me). My hope is we can learn from each other...as a rising tide lifts all boats.  
Interested in learning about a specific area of machine learning?    Then leave it in the comments section below.  

Signing off for now.
