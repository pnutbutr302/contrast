# To ML or Not ML: Five decision criteria for when to use Machine Learning

_ML is like the songs from the Sirens in Greek myhtology, luring product managers with its buzz, only to get shirwrecked by not following the assessment criteria below.  Don't end up shipwrecked._

**1. Complexity**

Don't use ML for simple problems.  Deconstruct problems to truly understand their nature.  Many times personalization can be achieved with simple rule statements, such as "if --> then" on the backend.  In other words, don't use a sledgehammer to drive a nail.  

 
**2. Scale**

Email spam identification is a classic application ripe for ML because a classification alogrithm can easily scale across thousands or millions of users.  So, consider how big your problem is because the investment to build an ML solution can be considerable.  Netflix, for example, uses humans to assign tags to movies because it's simply easier to hire a few diehard movie watchers to do the job.  (BTWs: Who wouldn't want to get paid to watch movies?!?!)   


**3. Interpretability**

This topic often makes many Corporate Counsels and Risk Officers have an adverse reaction to ML.  Often times, data scientists can't explain exactly how a model arrives at its output.  Hence the term "black box".  So, if you work in a highly regulated industry, you should strongly consider how interpretability plays into your ML deployment decision making.

**4. Do you require precision?**

Models/Algorithms can be dialed in to be really strong outputs.  However, they are never 100%.  In fact, that is usually a sign that something is wrong if your model can output 100% accuracy.  So, consider the cost of a model being wrong: is it revenue for your ecommerce shopping product, or missing a cancer diagnosis?

**5. DATA!!!**

Ah. Data.  You're the product manager's friend you love to hate.  Sure it provides insights, growth tracking, objective milestones among other great purposes for us.  However, with ML, we have to be very careful to understand that just because we have data doesn't mean it can easily be used for ML. Some high-level initial considerations are:

* Quality: What's the quality of the data?  Are there tons of missing values?
* Amount: Are there enough data samples?
* Reliability: Is the data source reliable?
* Bias: is there embedded bias in the data?
* Privacy: Should you use the data? 
* Security: can you store the data securely?

## **Recap**
* Check yo self, before you wreck yo self.  Use this assessment list to see if ML is the right solution for the problem.

* Getting the data component of ML right is critical to a successful outcome.
