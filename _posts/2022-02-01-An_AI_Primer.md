# So...What is artificial intelligence?
According to Wikipedia: _Artificial Intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans._

So, yeah, we're talking about a general area of study that involves trying to have machines, specifically computers learn to make decisions for us.  (Cool!)

## Is this AI thing new?  
No.  AI is still a pretty new discipline.  However, many of the concepts that make up AI are not that new.Below are great graphic of some key historic milestones:

## Framing the industry

Artificial Intelligence is the large discipline under which machine learning and deep learning reside.  Machine learning is teaching a computer to learn through the application of statistical and mathematical algorithms.  Deep learning...well, it's kind of out there...it's the capability for a computer to essentially teach itself rules to then make decisions.  Unfortunately, deep learing is often the headline grabbing part of AI that leads to this belief that AI is kind of magic wand that can solve anything as long as there is tons of data.  Not quite. 

## Let's drill down into ML.
Most of us in the product management community are familiar with classic programming rules engine that involves a series of "if --> then" statements to facilitate personalized experiences.  For example, 

_<center>if Suzy visited my website in the last X days, then show her Y content</center>_

In contrast, machine learning involves sharing a ton of data by which a machine learns how to make decisions.

## How is this a change?
Rules engines are still great techniques to use.  However, they have limitations due to (i) the volume of data available today and (ii) the complexity of the decisions we're asking of machines.  For example, Walmart has **75 MILLION** product SKUs on its website.  Creating a recommendation engine based on rules would be simply impossible.  
   
## We've entered a new era
Now product managers **CAN** create personalized reccommendations for Walmart shoppers on walmart.com!  Now, prodcuct managers can tell you how long that Uber driver will take to get to you!  I could go one with use cases, but I think you get the point.  (I'll use future blog posts to dive into some of these use cases.) 

## Recap
* Artificial Intelligence(AI)= large discipline; machine learning (ML) and deep learning are subsets of this disciple.
* AI concept is over 50+ years old but still evolving as computing power and data availability grows
* Machine Learning allows product managers to provide new interaction decisions for end users that were never possible before
